# <i class="fa-solid fa-user-group"></i> Student Group Work

## Overview

Your turn! The goal of this group work is to apply the knowledge you have acquired in the course to develop a cell (instance) segmentation pipeline on 2D images provided. Think of using all the tools you have learned in the course: smoothing, thresholding, morphological operations, thresholding, watershed, deep learning, fine-tuning, etc. The only constraint is that your predicted masks should be .png images of the same size as the ground truth.

## Challenges

**Segment the cell outlines**.

You are given a training set of 7 images and their corresponding ground truth masks. Your task is to take advantage of this training set to develop a segmentation pipeline that can segment the cell outlines in the images as closely as possible to the ground truth.

<!-- Then, you are given 3 test images to evaluate your pipeline against their corresponding ground truth masks that are kept secret. -->

<!-- 2. **Segment the cell outlines (noisy image)**.

You are given a single raw image, without its corresponding ground truth mask. Your task is to develop a segmentation pipeline that can segment the cell outlines in the image as closely as possible to the ground truth that is kept secret. -->

## Evaluation metrics

Evaluating segmentation pipelines is a complex task, and there is no single metric that can capture all the aspects of the performance. We have chosen to use the following metrics:

<!-- **The leaderboard will be based on the mAP metric. The other metrics are also important, but we will not use them to rank teams.** -->

--- 
- **mAP**: The mean average precision is the average of the average precision for each class. It is computed as the area under the precision-recall curve.

$$
\text{mAP} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{AP}_i = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \int_{0}^{1} \text{Precision}_i(r) \text{Recall}_i(r) dr
$$

<!-- ---

- **Precision**: The precision is the percentage of pixels that are correctly classified.

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{Number of correctly classified pixels}}{\text{Total number of pixels}}
$$

- **Recall**: The recall is the percentage of pixels that are correctly classified.

$$
\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{Number of correctly classified pixels}}{\text{Total number of pixels in the ground truth}}
$$

- **Intersection over Union (IoU)**: The intersection over union is the ratio of the intersection of the predicted and ground truth masks to the union of the two masks.

$$
\text{IoU} = \frac{\text{Intersection}}{\text{Union}}
$$

- **Pixel accuracy**: The pixel accuracy is the percentage of pixels that are correctly classified.

$$
\text{Pixel accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of correctly classified pixels}}{\text{Total number of pixels}}
$$

- **Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)**: The mean intersection over union is the average of the intersection over union for each class.

$$
\text{mIoU} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\text{Intersection}_i}{\text{Union}_i}
$$

- **Pixel F1 score**: The pixel F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.

$$
\text{Pixel F1 score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
$$ -->
